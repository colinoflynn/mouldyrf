# MouldyRF - It's for RF Prototyping, not for fungus.

Some FAQ:

###What the hell is this?

In 2012 I designed this board for my own use when testing various RF parts. I had plans to sell them, but it's a lot of work and as of 2016 have had zero time for this. Instead it's now an open-source project.

###What parts does it fit?

It can shittily fit most parts. I've used this board with SOT-23, SOT-363, SOT-343, SOT-89, 4-pin plastic, SOIC-8, 0603, 0805, and 1206 parts.

###How do I get them?

Download the two gerber-file zips, and send them to your preferred fab house. Wait. Get boards back. Note the gerbers are slightly crazy and may crash some online gerber file submissions.

###Can I sell them in my webstore?

The license is officially CC BY-SA, as I didn't want to deal with the hassles of a special license. But I do ask that if you offer them in your webstore, you add a $0.15 US/EUR (or approximate it local currency) surcharge and donate this to your local SPCA per board sold. If you make a big donation please let me know as it will make me happy.

###Your RF design sucks.

The multi-package area near the microstrip screws up a lot of stuff, but it was more than good enough for what I'm doing. I immediately quit trying once it vaguely worked.

###Generating the gerber files takes forever!

That is true. It takes like an hour to generate gerbers from the Eagle project files.

##Images of the boards + uses:

NOTE: The old version of this image makes reference to patent pending, which was part of what I had in there when talking to people about selling this commercially. There are NO such restrictions. There was a patent application I abandoned, which was mostly done at the time to prevent someone else from applying for one. Now it serves as a method of notifing the USPTO about this design (i.e., it shows up in their own search, as USPTO examiners do not search outside of their database). This helps guarantee the design remains open-source for the future and can be used by the community.
